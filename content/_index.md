**Wishlist [Arcane Survival](https://s.team/a/2571560) on Steam**

What I do:
- I eat, sleep, and shit game development. I've been doing it for 8 years, creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime) as I go

- Currently working on *Arcane Survival*, which is a 2D open world survival crafting game. I [live stream](https://twitch.tv/randy) development regularly.

- I'm building out a lean game studio that's focused on creating and shipping banger games with great tech. Eventually, the goal is to be shipping AAA quality games with a very small group of people. To spit in the face of the status quo.
