What I do:
- I eat, shit, and breathe game development. I've been doing it for 8 years, creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime) as I go

- Currently working on *Arcane Survival*, which is a 2D open world survival crafting game. I [live stream](https://twitch.tv/randy) development regularly.

- I'm building out a lean game studio that's focused on creating and shipping banger games with great tech. I'm always on the lookout for new people to work with, you can check out my [open positions here](/work).
