My game [ARCANA](https://s.team/a/2571560) on Steam

What I do:
- I eat, sleep, and shit game development. I've been doing it for 8 years, creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime) as I go.

- In my spare time, I help other people program games in C via [the Skool community](https://www.skool.com/game-dev).

- I'm building out a lean game studio that's focused on creating and shipping banger games with great tech. Eventually, the goal is to be shipping AAA quality games with a very small group of people. To spit in the face of the status quo.

See [/work](/work) if you'd like to join the team.
