Wishlist [The Game](https://s.team/a/2571560) on Steam

What I do:
- I eat, sleep, and shit game development. I've been doing it for 8 years, creating [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime) as I go.

- Currently working on a 2D open world survival crafting game. I [live stream](https://twitch.tv/randy) development regularly.

- I'm building out a lean game studio that's focused on creating and shipping banger games with great tech. Eventually, the goal is to be shipping AAA quality games with a very small group of people. To spit in the face of the status quo.

The best way to support what I do is by becoming a member [on Patreon](/patreon). It's the most direct way to help me develop the game faster and grow the studio.
