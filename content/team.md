My #1 goal right now...

Build a GREAT game studio, while recording & documenting the entire process on YouTube.

To do that, I need to surround myself with absolute champions.

Here's a broad list of roles:
- Videographer & Editor
- 3D artist (modelling + animation)
- Pixel artist / someone who's generally great at drawing eye catching stuff
- Sound designer (FMOD)
- Music producer
- Gameplay programmer
- Someone who likes doing CEO / operations stuff
- Girlfriend / business partner lmao
