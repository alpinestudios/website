Is this technically a post?

Welcome to my website course!

You're here because you want to learn how to make (and actually release) a video game from scratch without going insane.

This entire website is my attempt to share *everything* I've learnt so far on my gamedev journey.

Every single day I'm battle testing these ideas in an effort to ship high-quality games. As such, I'm constantly learning new ways of doing things. So I'll continue to update this website as I grow.

-> [next](course)
