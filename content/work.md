I'm always on the lookout for great people to work with. If you're extremely passionate about what you do and think work-life balance is a concept reserved for people who don't like what they do, then we'd probably get along really well.

Right now all efforts are going towards shipping [Arcane Survival](/arcane) while building up a killer team to tackle the next game... and then the next... and then the next...

If that sounds like something you're down for, then shoot me [an email](/contact).

## Steam Capsule Artist
I'm looking for someone to do a banger Steam capsule, and any other high quality marketing assets that're needed. If you've got experience in this domain and reckon you'd be able to cook up something amazing, then I'd love to hear from you!

## YouTube Video Editor
I'm looking for someone to help me dust of the v2 channel and crank out ABSOLUTE VOLUME with me, ideally in the form of stream highlights from [the weekday streams](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime/streams).

Since it's the second channel, it's important that we ship quick n' fast so the people who don't have the time to sit through a stream can still be a part of the community.

If you've got experience releasing YouTube videos, hit me up!

## Music / Sound Designer Homie
Let's spin up a DAW and crank out a sick OST together.

I've been doing all the sound design by myself so far and have been thoroughly enjoying it. I do it all in REAPER by kitbashing stuff together. I'm yet to attempt anything on the music front (aside from learning the basics), but I'd really love to learn (I've got a copy of Abelton Live raring to go).

I'm using FMOD for actually getting the audio into the game and would really like to pull out all the stops when it comes to creating beautiful soundscapes that evolve over time within the game events. I've had a bit of success with snapshots in this regard.

Ideally you've got experience making music for games and formating it to work with the procedural nature of things. If not though, we can always learn it as we go.

If you're down to work with me on this and essentially be a mentor for me in this domain, I'd be very grateful!

btw here's a [playlist mood board](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cELld6dxzKNS4GBlALMLW?si=2dc3cf3602e2471f) I've been prepping for a while now to give you a tase of some of the vibes I'd like to hit.

## 3D Artist & Animator
I'm in search of someone who knows their way around Blender and can help me crank out prototype low-poly assets for the next project.

Extra bonus points if you're great at animating.

## Guitar Chad
Simply put, I'm looking for a mentor who knows their way around the fretboard. So that I can ask a bunch questions and get advice on how to step up my game.
