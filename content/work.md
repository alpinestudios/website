I've got a list of positions I'm actively looking to fill out listed below. But I'm always on the lookout for other *sik kunts™️* that want to work with me on making great shit.

Right now all efforts are going towards shipping [Arcane Survival](/arcane) while building up a killer team to tackle the next game... and then the next... and then the next...

If that sounds like something you're down for, then shoot me [an email](/contact).

## CEO of Stream Highlights

I'm looking for someone to help me ship ABSOLUTE VOLUME to the second channel, ideally in the form of stream highlights from [the weekday streams](https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime/streams).

Since it's the second channel, it's important that we ship quick n' fast so the people who don't have the time to sit through a stream can still be a part of the community.

If you've got experience releasing YouTube videos and are keen on working together, I'd love to hear from you!

## Music / Sound Designer Homie
Let's spin up a DAW and crank out a sick OST together.

I've been doing all the sound design by myself so far and have been thoroughly enjoying it. I do it all in REAPER by kitbashing stuff together. I'm yet to attempt anything on the music front (aside from learning the basics), but I'd really love to learn (I've got a copy of Abelton Live raring to go).

I'm using FMOD for actually getting the audio into the game and would really like to pull out all the stops when it comes to creating beautiful soundscapes that evolve over time within the game events. I've had a bit of success with snapshots in this regard.

Ideally you've got experience making music for games and formating it to work with the procedural nature of things. If not though, we can always learn it as we go.

If you're down to work with me on this and essentially be a mentor for me in this domain, I'd be very grateful!

btw here's a [playlist mood board](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cELld6dxzKNS4GBlALMLW?si=2dc3cf3602e2471f) I've been prepping for a while now to give you a tase of some of the vibes I'd like to hit.
