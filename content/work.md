Life's work > work-life balance

What do I mean by that?

Well. If you're extremely passionate about what you do on a daily basis, work-life balance becomes irrelevant.

Here's a list of roles I'm looking out for.

Shoot me [an email](/contact) if the shoe fits.

## Pixel Artist
I need someone who can take my programmer art and turn it into something that'll catch eyes.

## Steam Capsule Artist
I'm looking for someone to do a banger Steam capsule, and any other high quality marketing assets that're needed.

## Programmer
Always on the lookout for more 10x'ers to join the team.

## 3D Artist & Animator
I'm in search of someone who can help me crank out prototype low-poly assets for the next project (bonus points if you're great at animating).
